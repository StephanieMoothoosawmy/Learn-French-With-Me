      <p align="justify"> Hello, and welcome to my website. 
        <br>
        <br> My name is Stephanie Moothoosawmy and I am a 2nd year student studying French at Queen Mary University of London. Driven by my passion for languages, I have created this website in order to help those who have just started learning French. As I was learning French, and even today, the best way I could make progress in my language learning process was through the use of online resources. Therefore, this website will provide you with the basics of the French language. Using the buttons at the top of the page to navigate, you will find a page that explains how to form and use the present tense of regular verbs, and, another page for the irregular verbs. Finally, to test your understanding of the present tense, you will find a page full of exercises to try out. 
        <br>
        <br> Thank you for visiting my website, I hope this provides a good starting point to your journey of learning the French language.</p>
